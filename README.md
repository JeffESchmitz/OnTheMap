iOS app displaying where Udacity students are studying on a map. 

The app allows students to post their map location of where they're studying. The map displays the student posts as pins. By tapping on a pin, users are presented with a URL from the posting student. Also, the user of the app can post their location and a URL of their choice as well.

This was the third project in the Udacity Nanodegree program. It utilized concepts learned in courses [iOS Networking with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421) and [Grand Central Dispatch(GCD)](https://www.udacity.com/course/grand-central-dispatch-gcd--ud576).
